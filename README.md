# SampleRNN-OPN
WIP of applying two-tier SampleRNN (https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkxKPDv5xl) to Oneohtrix Point Never's R+7 to create some novel samples that could be used for making music. Inspired by (https://mjrusso.com/augmenting-creativity/) and the other existing SampleRNN Pytorch implementation which I could not get to run for me
